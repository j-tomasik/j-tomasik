### Hi there 👋 my name is Jack Tomasik

I am a full stack software engineer, and I was previously a paralegal and spent some time as a co-project mamanger for a startup build a pet app. I'm skilled at using React, Express, Node, JavaScript, Redux, Ruby on Rails, SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, HTML, CSS/SCSS and Material UI to build cool projects!
Looking to add Python and Typescript to my skillset in the near future.

You can check out some of my projects here:

<h3>📸🖼<a href="https://jt-memories.netlify.app/posts">Memories</a></h3>

Memories is a photo sharing platform, which allows for users to create posts to show a special memory and write about it. I also built a search feature for querying
a post by name or by tags. When you visit an indivudual post's page there is a recommended feature at the bottom of the page based on tags used to find more posts with athe posts image displayed as a link to that posts page. This project was built using the MERN stack, Material UI components on the frontend and functional React compoents using hooks and Redux for state management.

<h3>💪🏋️‍♂️<a href="https://jtomasik-gym.netlify.app/"></a>Gym Workout App</h3>

My workout app uses two third party APIs I found that will render components with gifs that display how to perform a wide varity of workout exercises. I also
use queries to display similar exercises based on muscle group selected or type of equipment to recommended additional options. I also utilized an API to fetch
and dislpay the thumbnails of YouTube videos for a selected exercise to offer the user an easy link to a source of additonal information about the exercise and
how to perform it.

<h3>🏕<a href="https://trip-camp.herokuapp.com/#/">Trip Camp</a></h3>

Trip Camp is a full stack clone of the website Hipcamp, used for booking places to stay for vacastiona and other types of trips. Users can view locations, book stays, manage their bookings and view and leave reviews for locations. I built this with Ruby on Rails for the backend and React.js for the frontend.


<h3>🌁<a href="https://j-tomasik.github.io/JS_art_map/">Art Map SF</a></h3>

This project i built using the Google Maps API and information from the city of San Fancisco related to their 1% art project. More info about the art project can be found in the 'About' section of the website. My application allows users to drop and remove pins on a map of the city to display specific public art locations in San Francisco and information about the piece of art and its creator.
