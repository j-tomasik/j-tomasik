## Hi there üëã My name is Jack Tomasik!

I am a **Full Stack Software Engineer**, living in the San Francisco Bay Area.

### My Story
I began learning about software engineering as a project mananger at Braidio working on a pet care mobile app. 

When the lockdowns began in March 2020 I picked up front end web development as a hobby. After lots of studying online and learning the fundamentals of software engineering, I enrolled in and completed the top ranked full-stack software engineering bootcamp **App Academy**. At App Academy I learned full stack web development and after graduating have been teaching students as a **Software Eningeer Associate**. App Academy has given me the skills to learn anything I want and the tools for building projects with several different tech stacks, as well as the deeper understanding and techncial ability to teach and explain concepts to other graduates.

In my free time I have also been working as a **software engineer** on a healthcare SaaS product for a company that I co-founded called **RecordOp**. We have been building out an API for integrating diffrent EHRs together for doctors to easily access patient data. Me and the team have also been working on automations for alerting doctors when their patients lab and test results are have passed a certain thershold and are concerning enough to require immediate attention and action. Our tech stach has been **Next.js** with **Typescript** and some additional **Express.js** server functionality.

My most recent solo project was built with **Python and Django backend** which I really enjoy working with. During the bootcamp I started with building backends using **Ruby on Rails** (such as for my TripCamp project linked below). I then learned how to build backend servers with the **Express framework in the NodeJS** environment for a number of my other projects (such as Memories linked below).

I build my own front ends and have extensive experience with **Javascript React, and Redux**. More recently I have been working with **Typescript**. I have built front end components using HTML from scratch to style with **Tailwind** as well as vanilla **CSS** but have recently found a love for building my frontends using **Materil UI** components.

Additionally I have experience using both **relational and non-relational databses**. My projects have utilized **SQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB**.

### You can check out some of my projects here:

<h3>üì∏üñº<a href="https://jt-memories.netlify.app/posts">Memories</a></h3>

Memories is a photo sharing platform, which allows for users to create posts to show a special memory and write about it. I also built a search feature for querying
a post by name or by tags. When you visit an indivudual post's page there is a recommended feature at the bottom of the page based on tags used to find more posts with athe posts image displayed as a link to that posts page. This project was built using the MERN stack, Material UI components on the frontend and functional React compoents using hooks and Redux for state management.

<h3>üéµüéõÔ∏è<a href="https://django-playlist-controller.herokuapp.com/">Spotify Music Controller<a/></h3>

I built this project using Python for the backend with a Django  framework. I used a the Spotify API to have users log into their account to access the currently playing song so that other users can pause, play and skip songs. 
When creating a room, the host is able to chose the room's settings such as the number of votes needed to skip to the next song of the currently playlist. 
The host can share the room code with others who are then able to listen to the same song as other members that have currently joined the room!
-P.S. Make sure you have music playing from your spotify account before you create the room so the API can fetch your 'currently playing song' to display the title and album cover art!

<h3>üí™üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<a href="https://jtomasik-gym.netlify.app/">Gym Workout App</a></h3>

My workout app uses two third party APIs I found that will render components with gifs that display how to perform a wide varity of workout exercises. I also
use queries to display similar exercises based on muscle group selected or type of equipment to recommended additional options. I also utilized an API to fetch
and dislpay the thumbnails of YouTube videos for a selected exercise to offer the user an easy link to a source of additonal information about the exercise and
how to perform it.

<h3>üèï<a href="https://trip-camp.herokuapp.com/#/">Trip Camp</a></h3>

Trip Camp is a full stack clone of the website Hipcamp, used for booking places to stay for vacastiona and other types of trips. Users can view locations, book stays, manage their bookings and view and leave reviews for locations. I built this with Ruby on Rails for the backend and React.js for the frontend.


<h3>üåÅ<a href="https://j-tomasik.github.io/JS_art_map/">Art Map SF</a></h3>

This project i built using the Google Maps API and information from the city of San Fancisco related to their 1% art project. More info about the art project can be found in the 'About' section of the website. My application allows users to drop and remove pins on a map of the city to display specific public art locations in San Francisco and information about the piece of art and its creator.
