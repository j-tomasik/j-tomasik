### Hi there 👋 my name is Jack Tomasik

I am a full stack software engineer, and I was previously a paralegal and spent some time as a co-project mamanger for a startup build a pet app. I'm skilled at using React, Express, Node, JavaScript, Redux, Ruby on Rails, SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, HTML, CSS/SCSS and Material UI to build cool projects!
Looking to add Python and Typescript to my skillset in the near future.

You can check out some of my projects here:

<h3>📸 🖼<a href="https://jt-memories.netlify.app/posts">Memories</a></h3>

Memories is a photo sharing platform, which allows for users to create posts to show a special memory and write about it. Working on building a search feature and a recommended feature based on tags used. This project was built using the MERN stack.

<h3>🏕 <a href="https://trip-camp.herokuapp.com/#/">Trip Camp</a></h3>

Trip Camp is a full stack clone of the website Hipcamp, used for booking places to stay for vacastiona and other types of trips. Users can view locations, book stays, manage their bookings and view and leave reviews for locations. I built this with Ruby on Rails for the backend and React.js for the frontend.


<h3>🌁 <a href="https://j-tomasik.github.io/JS_art_map/">Art Map SF</a></h3>

This project i built using the Google Maps API and information from the city of San Fancisco related to their 1% art project. More info about the art project can be found in the 'About' section of the website. My application allows users to drop and remove pins on a map of the city to display specific public art locations in San Francisco and information about the piece of art and its creator.
