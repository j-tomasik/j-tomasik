### Hi there üëã my name is Jack Tomasik

I am a full stack software engineer, and I was previously a paralegal and spent some time as a co-project mamanger for a pet app. I'm comfortable in React.js, Redux.js, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Express.js, Node.js, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, SQLite3, SQL, MongoDB, Mongoose ODM, ActiveRecord, ActionCable, HTML, CSS, SCSS, jQuery, Jbuilder, and AJAX! Looking to add Python and Typescript to my skillset in the near future.

You can check out some of my projects here:

<h3>üèï <a href="https://trip-camp.herokuapp.com/#/">Trip Camp</a></h3>

Trip Camp is a full stack clone of the website Hipcamp, used for booking places to stay for vacastiona and other types of trips. Users can view locations, book stays, manage their bookings and view and leave reviews for locations. I built this with Ruby on Rails for the backend and React.js for the frontend.

<h3>üç± <a href="https://we-sample.herokuapp.com/#/">We Sample</a></h3>

We Sample is a food ordering platform, which allows for both restaurant owners to add their establishments to their profile and create a menu of sample items for customers using the app. As well as for user to view participating restuarants and sample items to add to their orders and leave reviews. This project was built using the MERN stack.

<h3>üåÅ <a href="https://j-tomasik.github.io/JS_art_map/">Art Map SF</a></h3>

This project i built using the Google Maps API and information from the city of San Fancisco related to their 1% art project. More info about the art project can be found in the 'About' section of the website. My application allows users to drop and remove pins on a map of the city to display specific public art locations in San Francisco and information about the piece of art and its creator.
